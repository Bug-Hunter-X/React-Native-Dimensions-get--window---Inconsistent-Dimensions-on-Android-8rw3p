This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, especially on Android devices.  The issue is that `Dimensions.get('window')` might return incorrect or inconsistent values, particularly during the initial render or after device rotation.  This can lead to layout issues where components are rendered incorrectly sized or positioned.

```javascript
import { Dimensions, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      {/* Content here, positioned based on width and height */}
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    width: width,
    height: height,
    backgroundColor: 'red',
  },
});

export default MyComponent;
```
